Description:
    Use this generator to convert an ApplicationRecord model into a GraphQL type and input. It can also generate policies and default mutations.

Example:
    rails generate graphql_type ModelName

    This will create:
        app/graphql/types/model_name_type.rb
        app/graphql/types/inputs/model_name_input.rb
        app/graphql/mutations/model_name_mutations/model_name_create.rb
        app/graphql/mutations/model_name_mutations/model_name_update.rb
        app/graphql/mutations/model_name_mutations/model_name_delete.rb
